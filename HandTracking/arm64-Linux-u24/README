	The runner script for XR Starter Pack's ARM64 Linux Hand Tracking.
	This script accepts 4 parameters:
	1) cams - The number of cameras used in your hand tracking setup.
	2) fov  - The FOV of the cameras in your setup (should be identical).
	3) cams_distance - The distance between your N number of cameras.
	4) unit - The unit of your cams_distance.
		- cm=centimeters
		- in=inches
	5) detection_confidence - float (0.0 - 1.0) of the percentage confidence for the model to assert before returning an initial array of hand points.
	6) tracking_confidence  - float (0.0 - 1.0) of the percentage confidence for the model to assert before returning a continuing/tracked array of hand points. 

	Script call template:
	`run.sh [number of cameras] [FOV of cameras] [distance between cameras] [unit of distance] [detection confidence] [tracking confidence]`	

	An example script call for a hand tracking setup 
	- with two cameras,
	- each with an FOV of 90 degrees, 
	- that are six inches apart,
	- with a hand detection confidence of 0.5, and hand tracking confidence of 0.5,
	would be:
	`run.sh 2 90 6 in 0.5 0.5`
